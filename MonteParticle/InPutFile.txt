seed list for each interaction and one for the main
interaction data file list
total number of incident electrons
Energy of incident electrons
stdev of energy of incident electrons

Min Energy -- the energy where the program stops tracing the electron
Boundary potential energy V  -- the energy step at the boundary of the material and the bulk

output file names
other output info --- maybe some tags to say what info is wanted




Posible different output data files each should be stamped with relivent info: parameters above, date, time

Energy spectra of electrons that leave
Energy spectra broken down into interaction that started electron
Energy spectra and Angle
Charge distribution vs R
Charge distribution vs z
All the data -- good for debuging
Almost all the data -- good for data mining
